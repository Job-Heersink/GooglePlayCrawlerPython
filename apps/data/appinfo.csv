You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It‚Äôs an effective way to learn Dutch phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.<br><br>Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:<br><br><b>- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Dutch pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.<br><br><b>- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Dutch words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Dutch clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.<br><br><b>- Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Dutch. Mondly teaches you Dutch vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.<br><br><b>- Learn conversational Dutch.</b> Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Dutch vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Dutch clearly.<br><br><b>- Verb conjugations.</b> Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Dutch verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It‚Äôs faster and better than a dictionary.<br><br><b>- Statistics that make sense.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.<br><br><b>- The Leaderboard.</b> We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.<br><br><b>- Adaptive Learning.</b> We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner‚Äôs needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Dutch is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.<br><br>Before you know it, at the end of these Dutch lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.",Learn Dutch free in a fun and effective way.

With a right approach.<br><br>Have you (or one of your friends) ever wanted to learn to transcribe or play music by ear?<br><br>It is so important for a musician to know what you are hearing. A good musical ear helps when you are composing, improvising, transcribing melodies, or playing with others.<br><br>Most likely you have already tried different programs to learn to recognize intervals or even to acquire perfect pitch. However, although such programs develop your ear, but can you actually play any melody you hear as soon as you listen to it?<br><br>Imagine you could understand music‚Ä¶ It is like when somebody is talking to you, you not only hear pleasant sounds, but you recognize words and their meaning.<br><br>One day I came across Alain Benbassat&#39;s program called ‚ÄúFunctional Ear Trainer‚Äù and have been using it ever since. It is based on Alain&#39;s ear training method to learn to recognize tones.<br><br>The main difference between the Functional Ear Trainer and other methods is that it teaches you to distinguish between tones in the context of a particular musical key. You begin to recognize the role (or function) of each tone in this key, which is incredibly similar to its role in other keys of the same scale.<br><br>And it is *guaranteed* anyone can gradually develop this skill. It does not matter:<br>‚Äì who you are ‚Äì an absolute beginner in music or a virtuoso professional musician;<br>‚Äì how old you are ‚Äì a 3 yo kid or a 90+ adult;<br>‚Äì what musical instrument you play (you don&#39;t even have to play one).<br><br>The only requirement is to practice for 10 minutes a day.<br><br>I was so excited about this ear trainer that I have developed an Android app based on the Alain Benbassat method.

The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child&#39;s ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. <br>The verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.<br>MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use.

Partnering with you AND your child will be our privilege.<br><br>&quot;As a busy family of 6, tracking my kids behaviour in real time has been hugely beneficial. My kids love getting involved with setting their goals, which they get a huge sense of achievement reaching.

We set up &#39;streaks&#39; as a fun challenge, where kids can try and beat their previous best &#39;streak&#39; of thumbs up.<br><br>THUMB # ALLOCATION<br>Different families may put different emphasis on various behaviors, OR you may be trying to deal with/encourage a certain behavior your child is currently struggling with. For this reason, in the settings screen we have made it possible to change the number of thumbs up or down for different behaviors. For example, talking back may earn them 1 thumbs down, whereas lying may be changed to 3 thumbs down.<br><br>ACCESS PROTECTION<br>Most kids are fairly tech savvy and pretty smart.... to prevent them sneaking their own thumbs up, access protection via a thumb print or unique passcode can be set (not your phone passcode!)<br><br>MULTI GOAL SETUP<br>Once a goal is achieved an interactive fun screen pops up for your child, with the ability for parents to &#39;set again&#39; or &#39;close&#39; that particular goal. This feature is perfect for setting ongoing goals such as, &#39;achieve 10 thumbs up for daily screen time&#39;. Multiple goals may be set up for each child (and yes, they can be different for siblings!) and each of these goals can be reoccurring or one off achievements. There is a feature which allows you to award the goal immediately or store it for future use.<br><br>REPORTING<br>In the goal achieved screen: <br>- Reports the time your child took to achieve each particular goal. <br>On the goals Screen:<br>- How many thumbs they have been given for each day/period<br>- Current tracking on their current goals<br>- Which rewards have been stored and are still available to claim<br><br><br>KID FRIENDLY DESIGN<br>With interactive screens, fun graphics and noises, Thumsters was designed with kids in mind. Just as kids are becoming tech-savvy, we understand they are also becoming increasingly design-savvy!  We wanted the interface to be attractive to both our youngest customers (2+ years) and our teens using this app. For this reason we engaged an up and coming young talented Australian designer Caleb Gregory (15 years) to help us make the overall &#39;look and feel&#39; of Thumsters both appealing and relevant.<br><br><br>PREMIUM FEATURES:<br>MULTI DEVICE/FAMILY SHARING<br>The ability to sync the app across multiple devices and family users can be beneficial.

org.scratchjr.android,org.scratchjr.android,ScratchJr,"ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5 and up) to create their own interactive stories and games. Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.<br><br>ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http://scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children&#39;s cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.<br><br>We see coding (or computer programming) as a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.<br><br>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren&#39;t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.<br><br>ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and the Playful Invention Company. Two Sigma led the implementation of the Android version of ScratchJr. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company and Sarah Thomson.<br><br>If you enjoy using this free app, please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (http://www.scratchfoundation.org), a nonprofit organization that provides ongoing support for ScratchJr. We appreciate donations of all sizes, large and small.<br><br>This version of ScratchJr works only on tablets that are 7-inches or larger, and running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher.<br><br>Terms of Use: http://www.scratchjr.org/eula.html","With ScratchJr, young children (ages 5+) can learn to code -- and code to learn!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android&hl=en,https://android.clients.google.com/fdfe/getBrowseStream?ecp=CiaiCiMIEioCCAkyGwoVb3JnLnNjcmF0Y2hqci5hbmRyb2lkEAEYAw%3D%3D&n=21,"air.MusterenGames.ElHarezmiCoding,com.vblast.flipaclip,org.khankids.android,com.sega.sonic1px,de.softan.brainstorm,com.lingodeer,com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftPOHM","Education,Creativity",,0,USD,"1,000,000+ downloads",PEGI 3,3.8858695030212402,7492,4499,834,427,264,1465,"201 South Street<br/>Unit 102<br/>Boston, MA 02111",info@scratchjr.org,http://scratchjr.org,Scratch Foundation,Scratch Foundation,http://www.scratchjr.org/privacy.html,32,1.2.7,"Oct 31, 2019",* minor bug fixes,Varies with device,25828351,True,False,

The game is permanently updated and new dinos are added every month. We will also be adding new Jurassic World 3 dinosaurs when they are announced. This way you can watch the movie and follow the story while learning scientific facts about dinosaur history.<br><br>All our illustrations in the encyclopedia are original and scientifically reconstructed from real dinosaur skeletons. The art of the game is diverse but always tries to depict dinosaurs as the most recent discoveries show them, with feathers, correct anatomy and other known attributes. The periods, such as the Cretaceous or the Triassic, are also reconstructed according to the vegetation and environments typical of the different phases of the Mesozoic.<br><br>Become a great Philosoraptor with Dinosaur Master!",Learn 365 facts about more than 100 dinosaurs including Jurassic World ones.,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jurassic.world3.dinosaurs.for.kids&hl=en,https://android.clients.google.com/fdfe/getBrowseStream?ecp=CjeiCjQIEioCCAkyLAomY29tLmp1cmFzc2ljLndvcmxkMy5kaW5vc2F1cnMuZm9yLmtpZHMQARgD&n=21,"com.sega.sonic1px,com.lego.ninjago.rideninja,com.FDGEntertainment.redball4.gp,com.sega.sonicboomandroid,com.sega.sonicdash,com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM,com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftPOHM","Educational,Education",GAME,0,USD,"10,000+ downloads",PEGI 3,4.909090995788574,33,30,3,0,0,0,"Canillas 65, Espa√±a<br/>",nachocooper@gmail.com,,Sidereal Ark,Sidereal Ark,http://siderealark.com/dinosaur_master/privacy/,8,1.0.7,"Jan 4, 2020",Learn and play with Jurassic dinosaurs,4.3 and up,25094092,False,True,Contains ads

This is a common situation of newborns and a situation when <b>Baby Sleep</b> can help the most.<br><br>Sleep Baby helps your baby to fall asleep using classic <b>monotonous low frequency sounds</b> proven to be effective by <b>generations of parents</b>: <br>Such sounds include: <br>‚Ä¢ Shower<br>‚Ä¢ Washing machine<br>‚Ä¢ Car<br>‚Ä¢ Hairdryer<br>‚Ä¢ Vacuum cleaner<br>‚Ä¢ Shush<br>‚Ä¢ Fan<br>‚Ä¢ Train<br>‚Ä¢ Musicbox<br>‚Ä¢ Heartbeats<br>‚Ä¢ Sea and stream...<br><br>From practical experience, we have learned that such sounds are more effective as a lullaby than tones, music or sing.<br><br>Your babies will soon get used to it and when getting older even demand it and choose their own lullabies. The app becomes an integral part of the babies and their parent every day sleep routine.<br><br>Even for older babies Baby Sleep helps to increase the overall noise level in the room, so that sudden urban sounds like traffic would not disturb your baby from sleeping.<br><br>Baby Sleep is easy to use so that even your babies can start the lullaby.

A fairy tale in hindi is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children&#39;s literature.<br><br>An audiobook (or talking book) is a recording of a text being read.

AST can also be used by older children and adults who have speech sound problems. The app uses pictures that are attractive to children to help them improve their speech sound production and in turn forms an easy home tool to supplement therapy implemented in the clinic which might minimize the duration of therapy and number of visits to the speech clinic. AST includes all the standard speech sounds in Arabic and 84 short syllables (i.e., consonant+ vowel) and includes 252 picture-word stimuli form everyday life. At the beginning of therapy, the speech therapist chooses the target sounds to train the client on in therapy at the clinic. Then, the clinician explains the use of the app to the parents and or client depending on the age of the client to help provide more training opportunities on the target sounds outside the speech clinic. This app can augment what a client is trained on at the clinic which might help accelerate gains in speech therapy. A user can choose the sound to train on by pressing the icon of the sound on the screen and then choosing the desired syllable and then choosing the words that contain the sound.

It helps to inculcate interest and positive attitude towards learning since a very early age. Learning by doing or Experiential learning is one of the most recommended way to introducing basic concepts to infants and babies. <br><br>Quoting experts on kid&#39;s learning styles: <br>&quot;Children enter kindergarten as kinesthetic and tactual learners, moving and touching everything as they learn. By second or third grade, some students have become visual learners. During the late elementary years some students, primarily females, become auditory learners. Yet, many adults, especially males, maintain kinesthetic and tactual strengths throughout their lives.&quot; (Teaching Secondary Students Through Their Individual Learning Styles, Rita Stafford and Kenneth J.
