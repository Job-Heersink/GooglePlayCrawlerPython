com.spotify.music,8.5.57.1164,1589550426885,3,It was fine at first and it became my favorite music app. But now when i try to make a new playlist it won't let me add songs. It stops after like ten songs. Then i gotta go out of it and add it the other way through my like songs. Tried deleting it and redownloading it but it doesn't help. Now the app on my laptop tweaks too. After i play a few songs it starts over and if i tried to skip it starts over. This started after i upgraded to premium. I thought it would get better not worse,109529746927316206063,Ms Panda Bear,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gg3ItoBayUv12E3wKRX8UrX--FoexOfashjwlxxTA

Secondly, the reason I prefer using an APP like TIDAL over Spotify is because it allows users to swipe up from the bottom tab that says the currently playing song. I've seen this implemented in many apps and Spotify would be great. the now playing needs a refresh - it looks dull! Finally, could you consider the desktop version and let us stream any song with ads? > Shuffle",109878925451895289564,Liam Chen,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-24dJhqGwz4s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucktYzMGlkzzsZb5ua6NnXRFWZlX9A/photo.jpg
