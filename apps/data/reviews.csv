I can't even see other people's pictures unless they send me them in a groupchat/chat with me. It lags in chat and sometimes I don't get their message 'til hours later. It's VERY annoying. Sometimes it'll freeze when I'm looking for a good filter or when I'm in the middle of editing the picture. If these things get fixed, it'll be 4 or 5 stars.",102724575121889831677,Cherie Negron,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RbrqEnh_F4U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rceVnFIWIOVcQvjR5lCSVn18UzJHA/photo.jpg

Your chats disappear at the best possible times!üôÇ The worst thing is the Support Team, I moved to a new country and as a result, I stopped using my phone number then I forgot my password and they couldn't help me recover my account. Literally every social media app out there would let you recover your account with just the email address, but Snapchat has to be extra! I will give them 2 stars though because they have some really nice filters.",113431081236544893703,Tanaka Marape,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-li5KMDM0RUg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf2XEmriUSD75i4fu5eHI8HetIErg/photo.jpg

Overall it's a great app, but I have a complaint about the username situation. It's understandable to not have them change so no one has the same username, yet I think many people especially teens who made their accounts when younger, would love to change their rather odd and absurd names. If not I would love to have some option to sync two accounts to combine all the saved data into one.",104243653160256215108,Loreta Rodriguez,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mARXytXwNgl_hZzsEtJ9TmTYVYAHsJHysQ7d4Cz

I get notifications for snaps, but when I open the app everything is frozen, now it will not even load. I wish they will work to fix these issues, not updating the format, not adding new font options, just fixing these bugs that make using the app impossible. I'll leave four stars since I enjoy this app, but three stars feels better considering the bugs and issues.",103418003459802150650,Miss Borealis,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBUekzTJqJHyRHtly4ysH5HGY9k8O1h-x8fCM3-WQ
